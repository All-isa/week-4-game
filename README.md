Crystal Collector - Week Four Homework

As soon as you open this game it will give you a random number. You are given four gems and each gem is randomly assigned a number. It is up to you the player to click each gem enough time to match the random number. If you go over the number you will automatically be reset and a loss will be counted in your tally. If you match the amount exactly, youll receive a win in your tally and the game will reset.
